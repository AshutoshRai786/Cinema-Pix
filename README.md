# Cinema Pix iOS Application

Cinema Pix is a cinema showtime aggregator application that displays movie showtimes at different cinemas and the movies shown in those cinemas, across Sydney.

CinemaPix aims to centralize and simplify the process of finding movie showtimes by aggregating data from cinema APIs, eliminating the inefficiency of navigating multiple websites, and providing users with an intuitive, map-based platform for discovering showtimes tailored to their preferences.
